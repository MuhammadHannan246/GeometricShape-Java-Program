1) In this program I used Object-Oriented Programming in Java.
2) In this program we have a parent abstract class GeometricShape, which have abstract public void getArea() and abstract public void getPerimeter() two methods which we Override in the child class.
3) Here I made two child classes one is class Oval which extends the class GeometricShape, this child class also have two set and two get methods.
4) Another child class I made in this program which is class Circle extends class Oval.
